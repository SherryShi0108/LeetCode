/*******************************************************************************************************************************
 * 
 * Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
 *
 * Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.
 *
 * The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:
 *              4
 *            /   \
 *           2      6
 *          / \
 *         1   3
 *
 * while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
 *
 * Note:
 *      The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
 *      The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.
 *      This question is the same as 530
